The requirements and the goals of the application that I delveoped was to add the required user interfaces. Implement the required mathematical components such as the math variables, math operations, and the math methods. Lastly, I had to implement the library component such as creating variables, add branching, programming the library components, and incorporate logic operators. The goals of this application was to create a a zip file that containing all of the coding files to produce the correct output. The user needs that this project was designed to address was registering for classes and asigning credits but not allowing more than 9 credits to be enrolled at one time. 
When creating this application I believe that I did particulary well in creating a new course.cs to ensure that my courses would be added to my application. I also believe that I did particulary well in adjusting my code to make sure that the code ran without any errors and produced the correct output.
